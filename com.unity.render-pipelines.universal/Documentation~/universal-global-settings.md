# Universal Global Settings

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) adds the URP Settings tab to Unity's Graphics Settings window. You can use this tab to set up default settings for certain features in your Project.

The URP Settings tab is part of the Graphics Settings window. To get to this tab, select **Edit > Project Settings > Graphics** and then, in the sidebar, click **URP Settings**.
